zone cold and he don't careHe's a problem child what bothers him all comes outWhen he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out'Cos he hates him so bad that he blocks him outBut if he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him outHis thoughts are whacked he's mad so he's talkin' backTalkin' black brainwashed from rock and rapHe sags his pants two rags and a stockin' capHis step father hit him so he socked him backAnd broke his nose this house is a broken homeThere's no control he just lets his emotions go(C'mon)Sing with me(Sing)Sing for the year(Sing)Sing for the laughterSing for the tear(C'mon)Sing with me just for todayMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you awayEntertainment is danger intertwine it with gangstersIn the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctumOnly you're unholy only have one homeyOnly this gun lonely 'cuz don't anyone know meBut everybody just feels like they can relateI guess words are a motherfucker they can be greatOr they can be great or even worse they can teach hateIts like kids hang on every single statement we makeLike they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinumNow how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'To havin' a fortune no more kissin' assBut then these critics crucify you journalists try to burn youFans turn on you attorney's all gonna turn it toTo get their hands on every dime you haveThey want you to lose your mind every time you madSo they can try to make you out to look like a loose canonYou need to spew don't hesitate to produce air gunsThats why these prosecutors wanna convict meSwiftly just to get me off these streets quicklyBut all their kids been listen to me religiouslySo I'm signin' cds while police fingerprint meThey're for the judges daughter but his grudge is against meIf I'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense, PeteIt's all political if my music is literal and I'm a criminalHow the fuck can I raise a little girl?I couldn't I wouldn't be fit toYou're full of shit too Guerrera that was a fist that hit youSing with me(Sing)Sing for the year(Sing)Sing for the laughterSing for the tear(C'mon)Sing with me just for todayMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you awayThey say music can alter moods and talk to youBut can it load a gun for you and cock it too?Well if it can then the next time you assault a dudeJust tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get suedSee what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistolsAnd they want to get one 'cos they think the shit's coolNot knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselvesWe're entertainers of course this shit's affectin' our salesYou ignoramus but music is reflection of selfWe just explain it and then we get our checks in the mailIt's fucked up ain't it how we can come from practically nothin'To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wantedIt's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thingExcept for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazineWho post pinup pictures on their walls all day longIdolize their favorite rappers and know all they songsOr for anyone who's ever been through shit in they livesSo they sit and they cry at night wishin' they dieTill they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibeWe're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyesThat's why we seize the moment and try to freeze it and own itSqueeze it and hold it 'cos we consider these minutes goldenAnd maybe they'll admit it when we're goneJust let our spirits live on through out lyrics that you hear in our songsAnd we canSing with me(Sing)Sing for the year(Sing)Sing for the laughterSing for the tear(C'mon)Sing with me just for todayMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you awaySing with me(Sing)Sing for the year(Sing)Sing for the laughterSing

one, now I got twoOohNow I'm sittin here, with your name on my skinI can't believe I went and did that stupid shit againMy next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be KimShitIf you only knew how much I hated youFor every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us throughThen I wouldn't be standin' here cryin' over youOohYou don't know how sick you make meYou make me fuckin' sick to my stomachEvery time I think of you I pukeYou must just not knowYou may not think you do but you doEvery time I think of you I pukeI was gonna take the time to sit downAnd write you a little letterBut I thought a song would probably be a little betterInstead of a letter, that you probably just shred up, yeahI stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made stopAnd think of how much of a waste it'd be for me to put some inkTo a stupid piece of paper, I'd rather let you seeHow much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyleYou're a fuckin' cokehead slut, I hope you fuckin' dieYou get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eyeI hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut, I hope you dieDieBut please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or madIt's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you backIt's just that when I

But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches;nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes. Trippin over O.D bodies of dead lushes,bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red slushies.Doors open and close by themselves, books fly off shelves, the curtains catch fire; the house melts.My skin blisters, and sticks together like twin sisters,the wind blows, and shatters windows like ten twisters.Caught a piece of shrapnel in the Adam's apple,two cups of Holy water and I'm lookin' at em' half full.But as soon as I go to touch em' they into red rum,it got silent then all of these voices said...Voices"Come Follow me into the pits of Hell"EminemI heard them yellVoices "Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel"End VerseI rang the bell for service and I was greeted by his mother,covered in dry blood, head still dented from the shovel.I said, "I need a room so I can try to get some rest." She gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag a cessand told me that's just for starters;Satan will be in to see me later, to see if I'm interested in being partners.Just the two of us, just the two of usJust the two of us, just the two of usJust the two of us, just the two of usJust the two of us, just the two of usBaby, your da-da loves you(Hey)And I'ma always be here for you, no matter what happens(Hey)You're all I got in this worldI would never give you up for nothin'Nobody in this world is ever gonnaKeep you from me, I love youC'mon, hai-hai, we goin' to the beachGrab a couple of toysAnd let da-da strap you in the car seatOh, where's Mama?

You owe me.** Remix, Extended Version; feat. Obie Trice:*10 seconds instrumental*Intro: ~Eminem~YeahObie Trice:Obie the person that came up and devertedCause of nervousness. - That was solely the homie's verdict.It was worth it cause he changed, became so I observed it,Certain such of a purpose.If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different versionSo much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain.That's why there's curtains in his murder if you gettin' worked up,I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher.I had enough of isolating myself in a roomWriting poems and songs, doin' the same in school.Now look what he became A fool,Cause he learned how to sustain his two and obtain fame from you?Living hard, but still JulliardA god walks in but ain't spent a day in a pew.Regardless of this, I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents,So welcome to the art department.Eminem:I stimulate the brain, mimick, emulate a saintCynic keep 'em thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't.Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, suck "Your-anus" (Uranus)Label me a genius if you ever seen as you would sayHe may seem as though he's plain normal if you ever meet himGreet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say.See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say,So he's vague. - So they mistake him for just bein' crazed.You part ways, your impression of him changed; you don't think he's strange?You turn around and tell him: "Peace and thanks."Then you catch him flippin' you off with his pants down, hands around his Scrotum,Tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs. (AAAHHH)Obie Trice:Obie the person that came up and devertedCause of nervousness. - That was solely the homie's verdict.It was worth it cause he changed, became so I observed it,Certain such of a purpose.If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different versionSo much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain.That's why there's curtains in his murder if you gettin' worked up,I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher.I had enough of isolating myself in a roomWriting poems and songs, doin' the same in school.Now look what he became A fool,Cause he learned how to sustain his two and obtain fame from you?Living hard, but still JulliardA god walks in but ain't spent a day in a pew.Regardless of this, I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents,So welcome to the art department.Eminem:It's all psychologic. - Why am I so maniacal?Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick? (bllabllablaaabbbb)Or am I truly psychotic, or are my molecules just diabolical?Cause biologically - I defy logic.By golly, haul me off on a trollyPro'ly want a crack, I'm back on that wacky tobacco.I'm a step away from Crack, Obie smacked the shit outta meI'm so slap happy, man. Snap me back to realityI'm a walkin' art gallery. - A science museum.Elephantiasis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see 'emI pull em out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cementI need an ambulance; I can't just put 'em back in my pants. (HELP ME)EminemMiscellaneousOur HouseHere's the story, of a little boy.Growin' up in a suburban home,Tying to cope with everyday life,Who lives in a little house,That was built, in the middle of the street."Hey, MomTupac's on the juke box,somebody shot two cops,and raped a little girl,while two dudes watched,""Nuh-uh They were tryin' to frame him,You wouldn't have Two Pack Shaker,""No That ain't how you say his name, maYou're so lame,Don't you know anything?""YeahI know that you'll probably go,and join in the gang,""Yeah, right.Where's my fuckin' walkman at?""Stop cussin' at me""Shut up, bitch""And quit talking back."Well,Slammed the door and I'm out,Now, what?It's probably warm in the house.Fuck, I forgot my jacket,forgot it was winter.I'm gettin' thinner,I'm hungry.Is Mom cookin' dinner?"MomLet me back inI forgot my coat.Mom, come on, I'm not playin',It's coldAlright, sorry.I need a jacket,Mom, look,My Tupac tape,I just cracked it,Mom, please let me back in,It is Two Pack Shaker,I just asked him."I'm freezin', (achoo)I'm sneezin',I'm breathin' too much cold air,I'm wheezin',"I ain't did nothin',I ain't say "I'm leavin',"I said "I'm goin' on the front porch to get somethin',""(scissors cutting)"Alright, here.Take your damn coat and leave,""Fine, I'll leave,Mom You cut off the sleaves"(Chorus 4x)Our house,In the middle of the street.One, two, three,My teacher's two faced,She went to lower my school grades,Since Last Tuesday,I had a toothache,from kool-aid,So Mom kicked me out, (get out)And, all i had in my suitcase,Was one shoelace,A tube sock,and a tube of toothpaste,Sometimes,It was cool,"cause I could go to a friend's,Crash there,Fool around and just skip school.But other times,I'd rather just be home,In my own room alone,Read my shit and nobody would know,My little brother sucked on a bottle,'Til he was six,So I'd hide it inside the couch,And say "I don't know where it is,"But as soon as Mom found it,I would either be grounded,or kicked out the house,a thousand week,.and still countin',Even when I was underage,Mom was tellin' cops,I was tryin' to run away,I told her,"Someday, bitch, you're gonna pay,"Please, Mom, Please, Mom, Please, Mom,I wanna stay, (let me stay)(Chorus 4x)My brother's incoherint,Mom's a single parent,Who ain't carin',Starin' through me,Like I'm transparent,Made it clear,That I was just there,to run an errands,Told her friends,I was a son from her last marriage,Sent me up to the little corner store,with a note,"Please, sell my step-son,Some cigarettes so I can smoke,"One time,I tried to fake sick,To get attention,Back-fired,Mom, sent me to school,With a vengence,My life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me,I go to class,and every teacher's always laughin' at me,And Mom says white rappers are laughed at.Not only that,She heard me upstairs,I can't rap,and I'm stupid,I never make an average,of a B+,I need to sit on my ass and sue people,Like she does,One time, I got food poisin,From a hot dog,Mom sued and got $2,000,From Ballpark,"Hey, Ma. You got a dollar?""I don't think so.Now keep an eye on your brother,I'm goin' to bingo.""But, Mom. You said you were broke.""Who said?You got your ears messed up,from that damn rap music."(Chorus Fades Out)EminemMiscellaneousNail In The CoffinEminemThis motherfucker here, just wont shut up will you?

throw that(Shut up)Mr. Shady will be your new substituteWhile Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia(He's got AIDS)Good luck Mr. ShadyHi there little boys and girls(Fuck you)Today we're gonna learn how to poison squirrelsBut first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob(Huh?)Say hi Bob(Hi Bob)Bob's 30 and still lives with his momAnd he don't got a job, 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes potBut his twelve year old brother looks up to him an awful lotAnd Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spotAnd wait in the parkin' lot for waitresses off the clockWhen it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dogDrag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks(Ahh)And even if they escaped and they got the copsThe ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the jobWhen she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talkBut Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it offBut Bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rockerCrazier than Slim Shady is off the vodkaYou couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a Dr.He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off herAnd dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find herBut ever since the day Stacey went off to wanderThey never found her and Bob still hangs at the waffle dinerAnd that's the story of Bob and his marijuanaAnd what it might do to youSo see if the squirrels want any, it's bad for youSee children, drugs are bad(C'mon)And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad(Ask him man)And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom(That's right)She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time(She will)So kids say no to drugs(That's right)So you don't act like everyone else does(Uh-huh)Then there's really nothin' else to say(Sing along)Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?Fuck, no you haven't seen it, it's the size of a peanut(Huh?)Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?Ecstasy is the worst drug in the worldIf someone ever offers it to you, don't do itKids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluidAnd spinal fluid is final, you won't get it backSo don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your backMeet Zach, twenty-one years oldAfter hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets boldAnd decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guysAnd peer pressure will win every time you try to fight itSuddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdriveAnd his eyes roll back in his skullHis back starts tah look like the McDonald's ArchesHe's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin'And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him"'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funnySo they're laughing at basically nothingExcept maybe wasting his moneyMeanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is overAnd his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yogaAnd that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniacSo don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for youSee children, drugs are bad(That's right)And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad(That's right)And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom(You can)She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time(She will)So kids say no to drugs(Smoke crack)So you don't act like everyone else does(That's right)And there's really nothin' else to say(But umm)Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?And last but not least, one of the most humungousProblems among young people today, is fungusIt grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it offBag it up and you put it right in your mouth and chew itYum, yum then you start to see some dumb stuffAnd everything slows down when you eat some of 'emAnd sometimes you see things that aren't there(Like what?)Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?)It's yarn Claire, women stick 'em up their behindsGo out and wear 'em(Huh?)And if you swallow too much of the magic mushroomsWhoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungusYa tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue(How come?)'Cause it comes from a cow's dung(Gross)See drugs are bad, it's a common factBut your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at(Oh)But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goateeAnd get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my faultSo don't do drugs and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for youSee children, drugs are bad(Uh-huh)And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad(Put that down)And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom(You can ask)She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time(And she will)So kids say no to drugs(Say no)So you don't act like everyone else does(Like I do)And there's really nothin' else to say(That's right)Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?Come on children, clap along(Shut up)Sing along childrenDrugs are just bad, drugs are just bad(South Park is gonna sue me)So don't do drugs childrenSo there'll be more for me(Mushrooms killed

have at least a half a million for my baby girlIt may be early to be planning this stuffCause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's toughCause man it's been rough, but still I manage enoughI've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffedMy hands have been cuffedBut I don't panic and huff, frantic and puffOr plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it eruptsI'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enoughAnd I'm sick of struggling and suffering, seeMy destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleasedWith my progress, I won't settle for less than cheeseI'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to callWay before my baby is able to crawlI'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivatesTo know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder bladesI

going for broke, gambling and playing for keepsEveryday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep Praying for sleepDreaming with a watering mouthWishing for a better life for my daughter and spouseIn this slaughtering house, caught up in boutsWith the root of all evilI've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitfulAnd make them do shit illegalFor these Grant's and Jackson'sThese transactions explain a man's actionsBut in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity Through God and there's a wish he granted meHe showed me how to cope with the stressAnd hope for the best, instead of mope and depressedAlways groping a mess, of flying over the nestTo selling dope with the restI quit smoking cess to open my chestLife is stressful inside this cesspool Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vesselMy little brother's trying to learn his mathematicsHe's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addictsKids attract static, children with automaticsTaking target practice on teens for Starter JacketsI'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slumI won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scumIt's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this EarthBut it's been

tonight I betcha that whatcha'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have sufferedCan't think of a better way to define poetic justiceCan I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive""Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"I flee the scene like it was my last rideYou see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first timeYou can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is goodAnd I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guyAnd to think I used to think you was the shit, bitchTo think it was you at one time I worshipped, shitThink you can hurt people and just keep getting away with itNot this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitchFinish this stitch so you can reap what you

rideYou see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first timeYou can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is goodAnd I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guyI've been driving around your side of this townLike 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes nowFinally I found your new address, park in your driveFeel like I been waiting on this moment all of my lifeAnd it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of salivaMy knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your houseSee, it's sad it came to this pointSuch a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see yaBut ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apologyOr your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seekSo I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom windowLike I reach my full potential, I peakedContinue to peep, still bent lowKeep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendoSneak all the way 'round to the back porchMan, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do thisYou don't plan for intruders before handSurprised to see me, cat got your tongueGag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lungLike you picked up an axe up and then swungStick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunkBy one of your fans, irony spectacular, huhNow who's a faggot, you punkAnd here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suckIt's just me, you and the music now, SlimI hope you hear it, we are in a car right nowWait, here comes my favorite lyric"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LPJust to try to get people to

gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck itSince you love your city so muchI figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right hereTwo more exits, town is quite nearI hope we

pig drove in this big, lincoln town carWell gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for youSlim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh, hope you can swim goodNow say you hate homos againI also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offendI'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still inI'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a penPerfect time to have some remorse to show for your sinNo, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly inWhen they say all of this is approaching its endBut you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over againBacks to the wall, I'm stacking up all them oddsToilets clogged, Yeah ‘cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all upBut in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollasAfter the track is demolishedI am your lack of a conscienceI'm the ringing in your earsI'm the polyps on the back of your tonsilsEating your vocal chords after your concertsI'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledgedGrab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallowI'm the bullies you hate, that you becameWith every faggot you slaughteredComing back on you every woman you insultThat, with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughtersI represent everything, you take for granted'Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facadeAnd Matthew and Stan's just symbolic, of you not knowing what you had until it's gone'Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are calling your nameCameras are offSad, but it happens to all of themI'm the hindsight to say, "I told you so"Foreshadows of all the things that are to followI'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrowIf you don't stop after they call you theBiggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quitsWhen it's time to walk awayI'm every guilt tripThe baggage you hadBut as you gather up all your possessionsIf there's anything you have left to sayUnless it makes an impact don't botherSo before you rest your caseBetter make sure you're packing a wallopSo one last time, I'm backBefore it fades into black and it's all overBehold the final

I wish that I would just die or get firedAnd drop from my label and stop with the fablesI'm not gonna be able to top on "My name is"And pigeon holdin' to some poppy sensationsThey cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stationsAnd I just do not got the patienceTo deal with these cocky CaucasiansWho think I'm some wigga who just tries to be black'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my ballsSo they always keep asking the same fucking questionsWhat school did I go to, what hood I grew up in, the why, the who, whatWhen and where and the how, 'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it outYou've been driving me crazyI can't take it, I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sitAnd I'm thankful for every fan that I get, but I can't take a shitIn the bathroom without someone standing by itNo I won't sign your autograph, you can call me an asshole, I'm glad'Cause I am, whatever you say I amIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?In the papers, the news, everyday I amRadio won't even play my

down, quiet downChildren, I'd like toduce our new substitute teacher for the dayHis name is Mr. ShadyChildren, quiet down pleaseBrian, don't throw that ()Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with Pneumonia ()Good luck Mr. ShadyHi there, little boys and girls ()Today we're going to learn how to poison squirrelsBut first I'd like you to meet my friend Bob ()Say hi Bob (Hi Bob), Bob's 30 and still lives with his momHe don't got a job cause Bob sits at home and smokes potBut his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lotAnd Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spotAnd wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clockWhen it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dogDrag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the chopping blockAnd even if they escaped and they got the copsThe ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the chargeTill one night Mrs. Stacy went off the jobWhen she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talkBut Stacy knew it was Bob and said knock it offBut Bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rockerCrazy good as Slim Shady is off the block, uhYou couldn't even take him to to give Bob a doctorGrabbed Stacy by the legs and chopped them off herAnd dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find herBut ever since the day Stacy went off to wander they never found herAnd Bob still hangs at the waffle dinerAnd that's the story of Bob and his marijuana and what it might do to youSo see if the squirrels want it, it's bad for you:See children, drugs are bad (come on)And if you don't believe me ask your dad (raise your hand)And if you don't believe him ask your mom (that's right)She'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)So kids say no to drugs (that's right)So you don't act like everyone else does (uh huh)And there's really nothing else to say (sing along)Drugs are just bad, m'kayMy penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen itFuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (huh?)Speaking of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrelsEcstasy, it's the worst drug in the worldIf someone ever offers it to you, don't do itKids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluidAnd spinal fluid is final, you won't get it backSo don't get attached it'll attack every bone in your backMeet Zach, 21 years oldAfter hanging out with some friends at a frat party, he gets boldAnd decides to try five when he's bribed by five guysAnd peer pressure will win every time you try to fight itSuddenly, he starts to convulse, and his pulseGoes into hyperdrive, and his eyes roll back in his skullHis back arches up, looks like the McDonalds archesHe's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin'And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him."'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funnySo they're laughing at basically nothing, except maybe wasting their moneyMeanwhile Zach's in a coma, the action is overAnd his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicing yogaAnd that's the story of Zach: the ecstasy maniacSo don't even feed that to squirrels class, 'cause it's bad for you:See children, drugs are bad (that's right)And if you don't believe me ask your dad (that's right)And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can)She'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will)So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)And there's really nothing else to say (Uh huh)Drugs are just bad, m'kayAnd last but not least, one of the most humongousProblems among young people today, is fungusIt grows from cow manure, they pick it out wipe if off bag it upAnd you put it right in your mouth and chew it (Yum yum)And then you start to see some dumb stuffAnd everything slows down when you eat some of 'emAnd sometimes you see things that aren't there (like what?)Like fat women in g-strings with orange hair"Mr. Shady, what's a g-string?", it's yarn ClairWomen stick them up their behinds, go out and wear 'emAnd if you swallow too much of the magic mushroomsWhoops did I say magic mushrooms, I meant fungusYour tongue gets, all swole up like a cow's tongue (How come?)'Cause it comes from a cow's dungSee drugs are bad, it's a common factBut your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good atBut don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and go and ODThey're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goateeAnd get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my faultSo don't drugs and do exactly as I don't, because I'm bad for you:See children, drugs are bad (uh huh)And if you don't believe me ask your dad (put that down)And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can ask)She'll tell you how she does him all the time (and she will)So kids say no to drugs (say no)So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do)And there's really nothing else to say (that's right)Drugs are just bad, m'kay:Come on children, clap along ()Sing along children ()Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad ()So don't do drugs ()So there'll be more for me (Mushrooms killed Kenny...Ewww, ahhh)(So, fucked up, right now.)My tea's gone cold I'm

and I'm strangling 'emSmack Kim Basinger on a assLast month I spent two weeks on a vacationI had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStationDid you ever lay down, take a nap and loose it?I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap MusicI started off underground in a dark roomWith a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoonThat transform to a pen in case of a words warAnd opened the first door that led to the first floorI got attacked by a couple of rap actsThey wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacksI hit one over the head with a broken verbThe muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken wordBut it didn't work, and I finished him and his boysAnd disappeared from the scene without makin' a noiseI used up four bars but I earned a punchlineAnd proceeded to Level 2: Land of the UnsignedWe don't play those gamesWould you listen here?What I'm doin he're?Get me outta hereWe don't play those gamesThis is gettin' wildCan you tell me how?Let me out nowWe don't play those gamesHow'd I get in here?Let me outta hereWhat I'm doin' here?We don't play those gamesThis is no funGot me on the runRap 2K1I got attacked right away when I walked inBy a four-foot manager with a contract and a penI put up my force shield to block any attemptAt this shrimp drainin' my life twenty percentThe floor opened up and I almost fell insideBut I used my mic right, I swung to the other sideAnd just when I thought I avoided the booby trapI got slapped by a female MC with a doobie ragAnd this chick was tryin' to be herd like she raised cattleBut I remembered somethin' I seen on the Blaze BattleWhoever sold you them shoes, they fooled youI killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBUA record exec then appeared in a black limoAnd started to attack with a bag full of wack demosAnd I will admit: it was hard as hell to killSo I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio billI made it to the next level: Above GroundMy soundscanner then picks up on this bug soundI pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cockedAnd that's when this A&amp;R crawled from under a rockAnd start shootin' opinions, I stop, drop and I rollCause if they was to hit me, they'd penetrate to my soulI hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightlyHis street team was up on the roof tryin' to snipe meIt took a while to finish em all but I finally did itThen out comes this powerful beast known as the criticWith a fully loaded magazine and mad dramaMy harpoon shots just bounced off of his armorNow I wish I would've stayed down in the dark cavesI'm runnin' towards these big-ass fans with these sharp bladesBut he was right behind me holdin' a flame throwerSo I jumped through the blades and I died, game overGuess who?

wasn't my intentions, my intentions were goodI went through my whole career without ever mentioning *Suge*And that was just outta respect, for not running my mouthAnd talking about something that I knew nothing aboutPlus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beefSo I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teethWhile he's all over TV, down talking the manWho literally saved my life, like fuck it I understandThis is business, and this shit just isn't none of my businessI'm still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute, becauseThere used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme andWouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyingBut now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in itThe shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappingWe actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happeningMe and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with himAnd asked him not to start it, he wasn't going to go after himUntil Ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed himFuck it, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have itMeanwhile my attention's pulled in another directionSome receptionist at the Source who answers phones at his deskHas an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrectionTries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new recordBut now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came upWas through that publication, the same one that made me famousNow the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing?Well fuck it, that mothafucka could get it too, fuck him thenBut I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to thinkThat we just inherited 50's beef with Murder IncAnd he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mindWe still have soldiers that's on the front lineThat's willing to die for us as soon as we give the ordersNever to extort us, strictly to show they support usAnd maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the To show 'em we love 'em back and let them know how important it isTo have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our cornersTheir loyalty to us is worth more than any award isBut I ain't tryna have none of people hurt or murderedIt ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word itThan to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdictI'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any furtherBut don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppingI'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppingOff at your jaws well then I can, cause frankly I'm sick

envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonmentI just thought the shit'd be differentThere's somethin changed the minute that I got a whiff of itI started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin itAnd it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quitI just wanted a little bitThen it turned me to a monster, I became a hypocriteConcert after concert, I was rakin in the dough, rollin in greenHad the game hemmed up, like a sewing machineBut I was losin my freedom, there was nowhere for meto not go and be seen, and just go and be meAnd there was no in-betweenYou either loved it or hate it, every CD critics gave it a 3then three, years later they go back and re-rate itThen called "The Slim Shady LP" the greatest"The Marshall Mathers" was a classic, "The Eminem Show" was fantasticBut "Encore" just

problemsEverything, and follow meIf I was frozen inside of a momentIf I could capture time inside a capsuleAn hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through itIf I can grasp it, and just control what happens to itThen I can trap it, so no more time elapses through itIf raps could do it, maybe I could tap into itThen I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and BuicksTo

it's chaotic, but it's got your body moving as a unitUniting together tonight, so make it last and you better justLose yourself in this music, this moment we own itWe won't never let it go (go), you better move yourselfBecause tomorrow's ass can waitThere is no time, to sit there and procrastinateCause when we descend together, we begin to move as oneIn perfect unison just like the moon and sunIlluminate the room and humans soon become aluminumRhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the punBut if you close loose it once, I mean if you could let shit goRelax, take a breath, and just let it exit slowTo rest your soul, you could leave the rest to meIf I could give the world a hit of ecstasyTo make 'em feel the feeling that I'm feeling right this minuteCause I feel like the night won't end til I get finishedSo close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in itThe skies the limit tonight because the night's infiniteA high percentage, of black people and white mixed in itBut no one really

a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streetsYou can't define it, but you can feel itYou can feel it overflowing from the people who call you homeFrom people who are always proud to declare, 'I'm from Detroit'You took our country from it's infancy, into industryAnd your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel, muscle and sweatYou became the city that carried the countryThe city, like the sport, is built on dreamsPeople who would drive to you, driven to excelWho know nothing is accomplished without hardwork, without sacrificeWhen you hurt, we hurtYour streets witness our struggleYour bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered, of each factory closedWe've lived through the ups and the downsBut we remain, DetroitWe can never turn our backs on you Detroit, because we are youMy homeThe home of Motown, Cadillac and Joe LouisThrough all this, we cannot be defeated, because we have never been defeatedYou've built us, you've moved us, you've shaped usSometimes down, but never outTake strength in us, your peopleStay up Detroit.Yeah, lookIf I woulda rap about the crap that's out, that's the routeYou probably want me to take cause you're just dying to know what I thinkHear my take on some other rappersIf I was to say somethin about Paul Wall, you'd probably crap in your pantsCause I'm White and he's White, so he's like my competition I mean, rightNope, Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba, so b-b-b-b-b-bBut I don't compete with nobodyI just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffleAnd dance around my opponents, do donutsSometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesomeI'm like a sleepin giant and when I awake I'm like DreI just jump from outta nowhere and bite preyAnd sink my teeth in em and fill em, full of poisonAnd make a noise like a snake before I kill emAnd let em know that I just don't feel emAnd smack 'em with the backwards E on the Eminem emblemI was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face 'emTell 'em why, look 'em dead in the eye, then waste 'emAnd the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hellThen swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwellIn the shadows of all who are willing to sell their soulsFor this rap game and it g-g-goesOne-two-three, chk-chk one-two-threeChk-chk one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow meThere's nothing else for me to say, my

spread interamentallyWhen I stumbled upon this resolutionBy using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolutionYou couldn't see me with binocularsI armed like an octopusStep on stage and you get socked and pushedTalking that junk like you went black, guarded your backCome battle me and you get smacked as hard as you actWhen I rap I represent it and will never referee in itEvery minute so when I win it you never resent itI'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scentedYou got the point when I cleverly said itWomen Singing:Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight

game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you but damnI never knew it'd be like thisIf I did I wouldn't have done itYou ain't asked for none of this shitNow you're being punished?Things that should've been private with me and your mother is publicI can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want itI'll put out this last album then I'm done with itOne-hundred percent finishedFed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck itExcuse the cursing, baby, but just knowThat I'm a good person, though they portray me as coldAnd, if things should worsen,take this letter I wrote as a goodbye noteBecause your dad's at the end of his ropeI'm sliding down a slippery slopeAnyways sweetie, I better go, I'm getting sleepyLove dadShit, I don't knowIf I could rewind time like a tapeInside a boomboxOne day for every pillOr percocet that I ateCut down on the valiumThat'll hurt everythingBut death is turning so definite, waitThey got me all hooked up to some machineI love you, beingDidn't want you to know I was strugglingFeels like I'm underwaterSubmerged like a submarineJust heard that nurse sayMy liver and kidneys aren't functioningBeen flirtatious with deathSkirt-chasing, I guessIt's arrivederciSame nurse, just heard sayThey're unplugging meAnd it's your birthdayJade, I'm missing your birthdayBaby girl, I'm sorryI fucking hate when you hurt, HaiAnd sweeties, thank you for waitingTo open giftsBut, girls, you can just open 'emDad ain't making it home for ChristmasWish I had the strength to just blow a kissI go to make a fistBut I can't make one, I'm frozen stiffI yell, but nothing comes outI'm crying inside, I shoutMy vocal cords won't permit meI scream, but it's not allowedYou put your arm around mamaThe karma, wowI just thought about the aisleI'll never get to walk us downNever see youGraduate in your caps and gownsIt's 'bout to be 2008How's this happening now?I've got so much more to doAnd Proof, I'm truly sorryIf I let you down, but this tore me in twoThe thought of no more me and youYou gave me shoes, Nikes like newFor me for schoolDoody, I'm trying, but youYou were the glue that bindedSo many things, timeI'd give anything to rewind itI had to walk down my hallsAnd constantly be remindedBy pictures all on my wallsAnd I couldn't sleep at night 'causeThat image burned in my brainOf you on the tableMe falling across your bodyNot able to stand to save youGod, why did you take him?I'm tryna keep his legacy aliveBut I'm dying, where's Nathan?Little ladies, be braveTake care of your motherSmile pretty for picturesAlways cherish each otherI'll always love yaAnd I'll be in the back of your memoryAnd I know you'll never forget meJust don't get sad when rememberingAnd, little bro, keep making me proudYou better marry that girl'Cause she's faithfully downAnd when you're exchanging those sacred vowsJust know that if I could be there, I wouldAnd should you ever see parenthoodI know you'll be good at itOh, almost forgot to do somethingThank my father tooI actually learnt a lot from youYou taught me what not to doAnd Mom, wish I'd have had the chanceTo have one last heart-to-heartHonest and open talk to youDoody, I see youI go to walk to youAnd I can feel my soul leave my bodyAnd float across the roomNurses lean over the bedPulling tubes outThen the sheet over my headShut the room downGirls, please don't get upsetI see those cheeks soaking and wetAs you squeeze hold of my neckSo forcibly, don't wanna letMe go, pillow drenchedEmotional wrecksWith every secondEach closer to deathBut suddenly, I feel my heartBegin to beat slow, then a breathMachines go (beep, beep, beep)Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shitI'm tryna rewind time like a tapeFind an escapeMake a beelineTry and awakeFrom this dream, I need to re-findMy inner strengthTo remind meEven if a steep climb I must takeTo rewrite a mistakeI'm rewinding the tape(I don't want it)I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with itOne hundred percent finished, fed up with itI'm hanging it up, fuck itExcuse the cursing, baby, but just knowThat I'm a good person, though they portray me as coldAnd if things should worsen, but I bet you they won'tI'm

that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile RoadYou gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get itOr see what the big deal is, why it was and it still isTo be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limitsIt's different, it's a certain significance, a certificateof authenticity, you'd never even seeBut it's everything to me, it's my credibilityYou never seen heard smelled or met a real MCwho's incredible, up on the same pedestal as meBut yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough timeSit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymesGo to work and serve MCs in the lunchlineBut when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines goWho must I show, to bust my flowWhere must I go, who must I knowOr am I just another crab in the bucketCause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck itMaybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shitI'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out withI look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shitat the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfitAnd it's cold, tryin to travel this roadPlus I feel like I'm old, stuck in this battlin' modeMy defenses are so up, and one thing I don't wantis pity from no one, the city is no funThere is no sun, and it's so darkSometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apartfrom each one of my limbs, by each one of my friendsIt's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skinSometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know notwhat I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove topI just explode, the kettle gets so hotSometimes my mouth just overloads the gas that I don't gotBut I've learned, it's time for me to U-turnYo it only takes one time for me to get burnedAin't no fallin on next time I meet a new girlI can no longer play stupid or be immatureI got every ingredient, all I need is the courageLike I already got the beat, all I need is the wordsGot the urge, suddenly it's a surgeSuddenly a new burst of energy is occuredTime to show these free world leaders the three and a thirdI am no longer scared now, I'm free as a birdThen I turn and cross over the median curbHit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile RoadI'm a man, I'ma make a new planTime for me to just stand up, and travel new landTime for me to just take matters into my own handsOnce I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where

you?Straighten up little soldierStiffen up that upper lipWhat you crying about?You got meHailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dadWell I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never hadI can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laughI can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cryCause you're scared, I ain't there?Daddy's with you in your prayersNo more crying, wipe them tearsDaddy's here, no more nightmaresWe gon' pull together through it, we gon' do itLaney uncles crazy, ain't he?Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know itWe're all we got in this worldWhen it spins, when it swirlsWhen it whirls, when it twirlsTwo little beautiful girlsLookin' puzzled, in a dazeI know it's confusing youDaddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the newsI try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seemsThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on meAll the things growing up his daddy that he had to seeDaddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he didWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and meBut things have gotten so bad between usI don't see us ever being together ever againLike we used to be when we was teenagersBut then of course everything always happens for a reasonI guess it was never meant to beBut it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny isBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleepMaybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream(Tupac)Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with herAnonymous pictures of other niggaz tryin to kiss herWill I love her or shall I diss her?I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal witTryin to paint a perfect pictureMy memories of jealousy no longer carefreeCause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin meI'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open doorSo it got me thinkin, what am I tryin for?When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to pleasea lil', trick on a mission tryin to get (((him a peace)))Me and my niggaz is thug niggaz, former known drug dealersWe don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggazI gotta blame my attractionBut you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackinI thought you changed but now I knowCan't turn a hoe into a housewife, baby(Leona Lewis)Thought I couldn't live without youIt's gonna hurt when it heals tooOooh yeah(It'll all get better in time)Even though I really love youI'm gonna smile because I deserve too oooooh(It'll all get better in time)(Bridge)Since there's no more you and me (No more you

huhYou got a phone,Pick it up, call meHow come, we don't even talk no more,And you don't even call no more,We don't barely keep in touch at all,And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,After all the years we've been down,Ain't no way, no how,This bullshit can't be true,We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's youWe were so young,So full of life and vibrance,Side by side wherever you was ridin', I went,So close almost was some Bonnie and Clyde shit,When Ronnie died you was right by my side,With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it,You even had the same type of childhood I did,Sometimes I just wanna know why,Is it that you succumbed to yours,And mine I survived it,You ran the streets I nine to fived it,We grew up, grew apart this time went by us,Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises,Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it,Much as your pride tries to hide it,You're cold your touch is just like ice,And your eyes is the look of resentment,I can sense it and I don't like itHow come, we don't even talk no more,And you don't even call no more,We don't barely keep in touch at all,And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,After all the years we've been down,Ain't no way, no how,This bullshit can't be true,We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's youIt was my dream at first to be all spittin the verse,On my own album with a deal but shit got worse,So I came out I would'a killed a nigga first,'Fore I let him disrespect me,Or check me up with somethin' worse,Some bitch that I wasn't with,I would'a hit her to quit,But you were plain talkin' to her,And tell her she was the shit,I told you don't get involved with her,You were smoking the cron'c with her,Coming out'a the bar with her,Stumblin' half drunk,Like y'all was husband or wife or somthin',But me catchin' her kissin other guys,Must've hurt your pride or somthin','Cause you wolf I fit them after people,Like you want it with me,When all I tried to do is show you that your bitch was shifty,And lyrics is the fans and all the shit that I produce,You actin' like I ain't your man,And lyin' like she can't be loose,But I am really your friend,I'm just trying to tell you the truth,Don't hate the game or the playa',The one that's changin is youHow come, we don't even talk no more,And you don't even call no more,We don't barely keep in touch at all,And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin' now,After all the years we've been down,Ain't no way, no how,This bullshit can't be true,We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's youWe gettin lonely at the topcuz my homie had to stopnow we actin like i gotta live only for the blockand homies in the hood only see me on the tubeso they gossip on the porch, get

communicate with congressHas, been a problem for the longest I guessBut, maybe one day we can make some progressFood for thought, see how long it takes to digestFeeling good when I should be ashamedShit I really should've fell but I stoodSee I came like a flame in the nightLike a ghost in the darkThere's a rayThere's a lightThere's a hopeThere's a sparkBut when planets collideThey'll never see eye to eyeUntil they decideTo set the differences asideAnd this is whyOnly one of us will surviveSo children follow my leadAnd feel the vibe becauseI'm only entertaining youMy, goal is to stimulate making you highAnd take you and I, to a place that you can't seeBut I believe you can flyI don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardianJust a man who's on the micSo let me, entertain youMy, music can be slightly amusingYou shouldn't take lyrics so serious, It might be confusingTrying to separate the truth from entertainmentIt's stupid ain't it, I get sick of trying to explain itSee I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyondJust being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blondeCuz' I came here to uplift let your woes be goneTell em' to get

why I dominateI try to stimulate, but kids emulateAnd mimic every move you make, Slim you're greatBut wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertainI gotta be the one to go against the grain'Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it but it's inhumaneFor me to see you be influenced, and pretend you ain'tBut they don't understand that I've been through painIf you get to know me I can be a friend you gainBut you can't just stand there and try to judgeIt hurts, but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as muchAnd it's such a pleasure every button that I touchI treasure every glutton that I

PerhapsI'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.Till the roof comes off, till the lights go outTill my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.Till the smoke clears out and my high burn outI'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get when your realand you spit and people are feeling your shit.This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto itcause you may never get it again.So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you canand when your run is over just admit when its at its end.Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outcast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me.That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.Even though half you people got a fucking problem with me.You hate it but you know respect you've got to give meThe press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.Till the roof comes off, till the lights go outTill my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.Till the smoke clears out - am I high? PerhapsI'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.Till the roof comes off, till the lights go outTill my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.Till the smoke clears out and my high burn outI'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.Soon as a starts I eat it at MC's heartwhat is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.And its absurd how people hang on every word.I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserveBut I'll never be served my spot is forever reservedIf I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.That's why I'm clever when I put together everyMy thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addictI rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers.But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battlesThe fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at themThe track is on some battling raps who want some staticCause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim mattersA plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.Till the roof comes off, till the lights go outTill my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.Till the smoke clears out - am I high? PerhapsI'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.Till the roof comes off, till the lights go outTill my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.Till the smoke clears out and my high burn outI'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.Until the roofThe roof comes offUntil my legsgive out from underneath meI will not fall,I will stand tall,Feels like no one could beat meWhat tupI gotta tell you motherfuckers the truthThis is straight G shitAnd all you can do is respect itSwiftyWell I'ma state my name, Swift McVayNone of y'all niggaz got shit to sayRhymes keep comin off like a toupeePlus I'm big headed runnin things my wayA selfish man, the back of the handBe slappin the hell out of hoes because I canProstitute, I want my lootAnd I don't give a fuck about your broke-ass man andY'all givin niggaz what they needin'til bitches understand I'm mean andSwift McVay is, blowin upCourvosier 'til I'm throwin upWanna playa hate me, bitch so what?What's yo' function?

Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine outFuck it, you only live onceStep by step, heart to heartLeft right left, we all fall down like toy soldiersBit by bit, torn apartWe never win, but the battle wages on for toy soldiersI'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composureEven though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shouldersI ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know itEven if it means going toe to toe with a BenzinoIt don't matter I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle'less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an exampleI need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'emIf some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'emThat Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop itThere's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed itI heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost itIt was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shitAnd even though the battle is won I feel like we lost itI spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhaustedAnd I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused itThis ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in itThat was never my object, for someone to get killedWhy would I want to destroy something I helped build?It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were goodI went through my whole career without ever mentioning *Suge*And that was just outta respect, for not running my mouthAnd talking about something that I knew nothing aboutPlus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beefSo I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teethWhile he's all over TV, down talking the manWho literally saved my life, like fuck it I understandThis is business, and this shit just isn't none of my businessI'm still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute, becauseThere used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme andWouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyingBut now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in itThe shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappingWe actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happeningMe and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with himAnd asked him not to start it, he wasn't going to go after himUntil Ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed himFuck it, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have itMeanwhile my attention's pulled in another directionSome receptionist at the Source who answers phones at his deskHas an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrectionTries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new recordBut now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came upWas through that publication, the same one that made me famousNow the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing?Well fuck it, that mothafucka could get it too, fuck him thenBut I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to thinkThat we just inherited 50's beef with Murder IncAnd he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mindWe still have soldiers that's on the front lineThat's willing to die for us as soon as we give the ordersNever to extort us, strictly to show they support usAnd maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the To show 'em we love 'em back and let them know how important it isTo have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our cornersTheir loyalty to us is worth more than any award isBut I ain't tryna have none of people hurt or murderedIt ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word itThan to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdictI'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any furtherBut don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppingI'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppingOff at your jaws well then I can, cause frankly I'm sick of talkingI'm not going to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause(Yo) His palms are sweaty,

when it doesn't have to end?It ain't over 'til I say it's over – enough when I say enoughThrow me to them wolves and close the gate upI'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolvesWhen the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at itWait is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homieHold them bitches straighter up, wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuffCame up rough, came to
