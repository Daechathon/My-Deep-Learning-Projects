YoungDeezy taken over his soul yeah I'm an asshole but girls love it
Im blasting shit
Bitches on my johnson no magic shit
Niggas talking crazy about my city i ain't having it
Talking about new york fell off, ain't that some shit
If i ever see us falling off i bet im catching it
Paper on your head through a phone call im faxing shit
Oh and i get a quarter back and i sack a bitch
Adding bitches subtracting bitches that mathamatic shitt
Run up on your block and u get shocked when that static hit
Im acting up, u r l smack it up
Now u mad as fuck. you niggas softer than saggy nuts
Im stacking up this dough hotter than dragon butt
My flow catching up you ugly couldn't bag a slut
I was never used to
Being what i used to
Niggas carrying more than one strap so i used to
Always have to watch my own back so im used to
Talking to myself u would have thought i had a blue tooth
Y.U Niggas hating...Y.U Niggas mad
Yo why you mad
Stop being a trashbag and get glad
Jordeezy is my comrade
Like we was in a war cuz everybody getting mad
I dont claim to have 22 in my hand
The only thing I have is sand
Cuz i'll put ya to sleep like the sandman
30% rubber band man
Bombing pussy like a kamikaze
Every couple seconds i claim another victim
Is they survive then they suffer from stigmatism
Shut their whole body down like it was a system
Then tell them they had nothing to be mad or over
Next time you come after me make sure your sober
But at the end of the day imma ask you
Y u mad son?
Uh, Look
I got RichKid, Deezy, and my dawg Trae with me
The only realest day one niggas with me
I heard you talkin' about my music and how it ain't shit
My nigga, when was the last time you made a hit?
When was the last time, you got propped for a feature?
I got bars to give you a sugar rush then drop with a seizure
I got bars. hooks, flows, and even 808 tricks
Money, weed, lean, codeine and even yo' bitch
So don't tryna ask me for any collaborations
Coz we did it already, it's just celebrations
I'm got the colors of a zebra, I'm mixed
You got ghost writers, your hooks are fixed
We kill every track we're featured on
I could even finish you on a one-on-one
We're attached to this bitch Like a Pad
Yeah, but just tell me, Y U Mad?
And Look, I'm not tryna make you sound bad
So my nigga, just tell me, Y U mad?
For this life I cannot change
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main
M&M’s, sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it let it bang (Pop it, pop it)
For this life I cannot change
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main
M&M’s sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it let it bang (Pop it, pop it)
Drop the top play hide and seek
Jump inside, jump straight to the leak
Take a sip, feel just how I breathe
On freeway, but no ain’t nothin’ free (straight up)
Bend laws, bend lanes
Daylight, I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know but now, that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long, you made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for a boy like that to go on
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh
If you want it, yeah
You can have it, oh, oh, oh
If you need it, ooh

Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time
If you want it, oh
You can have it, you can have it
If you need it
You better believe in something
We can make it
If you want it
You can have it, aah!
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'

Gon' catch you sleepin'
Put your hands up on me

Been bustin’ bills, but still ain’t nothin’ change
You in the mob soon as you rock the chain
She caught the waves just thumbin’ through my braids (alright)
Heatin’ up, baby, I’m just heatin’ up (it’s lit)
Fiji lover, now they indeed that is impressive
Fill his cup now you know how they keep me up
Icy love, icy like a hockey puck
For this life I cannot change
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main
M&M’s sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it let it bang (Pop it, pop it)
For this life I cannot change
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main
M&M’s sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it let it bang (Pop it, pop it)
All the ones, all the chains piled on the mantle
All the dogs, all the dogs low creep right behind me in the Phantom
Never go, never go dip on this estates santana
Yeah, run it back turn the lights on when I hit up Green Lantern
Yeah, fly the broads, fly the dogs down to Atlanta
Yeah, in the cut in Medusa lay low I might be
Yeah, roll up help me calm down when I move in high speed
Yeah, If I send one need the text back ’cause you know what I need
Oh please (oh please)
Oh me (oh me)
Oh my (oh my)
We been movin’, we been movin’ for some time (Alright!)
Flexin’, flexin’ try to exercise
Exercise, exercise, exercise, exercise
For this life I cannot change
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main
M&M’s sweet like candy cane
Drop the top, pop it let it bang (Pop it, pop it)
For this life I cannot change
Hidden Hills, deep off in the main
